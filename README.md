# heuristic-algorithms
a demo application set for testing heuristic and optimization algorithms with pure java.

## com.bahtiyartan.heuristic.genetic.textprediction

this package contains a very simple implementation of **evalutionary approach**, but it is very useful to understand **basics of genetic programming**. It tries to predict given text with an **evalutionary method**. After running application it asks for final text and iteration count. After performing all iterations, if it can not find final result, it asks for more iterations. At each itereation, it prints best five individuals. **the main method of the application is included in App.java file, on same package**
   
   
## com.bahtiyartan.heuristic.antcolony.visualshortestpath

this package contains a simple **ant colony** example with a **visual representation**. With this case ants, try to **find shortest path despite the obstacles**. **the main method of the application is included App.java file, on same package**
